# 1. Viewing Source Code

To see how simple Modulo source code can be, right click and select "View
Source" to see the source code for any Modulo page in "Dev Mode". This page,
for example, was written in Markdown, using the
[modulo-starter](/modulo-starter/) starting template.


# 2. Running Dev Commands

Open up your browser's "Developer Console", and look for the percent-sign logo
to use the Modulo command menu. On most browsers, this involves right clicking
and select "Inspect..." from the menu, then clicking on "Console" in the new
browser panel that appears, and then clicking on "COMMANDS" to expand a
subsequent menu in your console. From there, you can click on one of those
commands to activate them. In the Chrome console, this will take one click, but
in the Firefox console, you may need to click twice.


# What is Modulo.js?

**To learn more and begin using the Modulo framework, visit
[ModuloJS.org](https://modulojs.org/)**

Modulo.js is a declarative HTML web component framework, focused on providing
beginner-friendly features inspired by popular frameworks such as Next.js,
React, Svelte, and Vue.js, except in a tiny, minimalist, “no fuss” drop-in
single-file of self-building JavaScript. Say goodbye to "node_modules": Modulo
is dependency-free!




**Modulo in "Dev Mode":** This website is for exploring Modulo.js tools and
documentation in "Dev Mode".  None of these pages are pre-built, but instead
are loading entirely in the browser, meaning you'll see a flash of an empty
page as the site dependencies load and render the page. It also means you can
practice building Modulo projects here, right from your browser!
