# Tutorial

**Modulo is one of the easiest frameworks to embed in existing applications.**

You can use as little or as much of Modulo's framework as you'd like.  Even
when embedded and without server-side rendering, Modulo can be used to develop
performant components.


## Starting in 3 Steps

Writing your first component takes only **3 steps**. You can follow these steps
in your text editor by either 1) creating a new, blank HTML file or 2) opening
an HTML file from one of your existing web apps or projects:

##### Step 1: Include Modulo

```html
<script Modulo src=https://modu.lol">
<-script>
```


##### Step 2: Define Components

```html
<script Modulo src=https://modu.lol>
    <Component name="Greet">
        <Template>
            <h2>Hey there, <slot></slot>!</h2>
        </Template>
    </Component>
<-script>
```

##### Step 3: Use Elsewhere

```html
<div>
    <x-Greet>Modulo</x-Greet>
    <x-Greet>my new <tt>HTML</tt>web component</x-Greet>
</div>
```
