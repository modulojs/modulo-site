# Modulo

Modulo is a lightweight framework for creating **HTML Web Components**: Reusable
snippets of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that create new HTML-like tags that can
be used and reused anywhere on your site.  Modulo runs entirely in the browser,
and can be incorporated with just a couple lines of code into any HTML file
(see the "Quick start"), such that **no terminal usage is necessary**. However,
if you prefer, you can also start projects using NPM from the Terminal (see the
"NPM start").

- Beginner-friendly features inspired by React, Svelte, and Vue.js, in only
  2000 lines of dependency-free, self-building JavaScript. A “no fuss” drop-in
  for existing web apps or Jamstack static sites.
