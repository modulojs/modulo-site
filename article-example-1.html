[Edit me!](?argv=edit)

**How to edit:** Edit Markdown by opening up `article-example.html` in a text
editor. Note that after `build`, this source file is replaced by pure HTML.

**GUI editing:** If you use a graphical Markdown editor, be sure to configure
the starting "meta" format as the entire first line of this file (i.e.
including the "script" tags AND the "---").

**Limitations:** The Modulo framework's built-in Markdown parser is geared
toward quick docs. If you need more features (e.g. lists), it's recommended to
swap in a new library.
