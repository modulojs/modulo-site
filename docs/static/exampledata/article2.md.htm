**Ramping Up vs Greenfielding** - Consider for a moment: Are you
"greenfielding" a project (for example, starting a new site from scratch), as
opposed to integrating or embedding the framework into an existing web
application (e.g. "brownfielding")? If you are "greenfielding", then it's
probably easiest to start with a starter. For example, the the framework
starter ZIP files both have the `static/index.html` and
`static/components/index.html` correctly set-up.  However, if you are "Ramping
Up" an integration into an existing project, then consider these options.
